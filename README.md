# Natural Language Processing with Disaster tweets


## Overview
This repository is created for the Kaggle "Twitter Disaster Detection" competition. The competition's goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether tweets are about real disasters or not. Twitter has become a crucial communication channel during emergencies, and this competition aims to programmatically monitor and classify tweets for disaster relief organizations and news agencies.

## Getting Started
- If you're new to NLP or want to quickly get started, you can take advantage of the provided [starter notebook](link-to-starter-notebook).
- The competition dataset contains 10,000 tweets that have been hand-classified.

## Environment
You can work on this competition using Kaggle Notebooks, a free and no-setup Jupyter Notebook environment. It's accessible at [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks).

## Dataset
The dataset for this competition may contain text that is considered profane, vulgar, or offensive. Please be aware of the content when working with the data.

## Discussion and Support

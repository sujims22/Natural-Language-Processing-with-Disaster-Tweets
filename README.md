# Natural Language Processing with Disaster tweets


## Overview
This repository is created for the Kaggle "Twitter Disaster Detection" competition. The competition's goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether tweets are about real disasters or not. Twitter has become a crucial communication channel during emergencies, and this competition aims to programmatically monitor and classify tweets for disaster relief organizations and news agencies.
